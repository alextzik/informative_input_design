# A General Bayesian Framework for Informative Input Design in System Identification

The repo contains codebase for the paper "A General Bayesian Framework for Informative Input Design in System Identification".

## Summary
We propose a methodology for informative input design that is applicable in the general case of nonlinear models.

## Code Organization
The code is organized as follows:

* ```main.py```
    * Contains the various methods presented in the paper and runs them to obtain the results

* ```dynamics.py```
    * Contains anything related to the dynamics and parametric model family

* ```method.py```
    * Contains the methods discussed in Sections IV-A and IV-B of the paper.

* ```helper_funcs.py```
    * Contains some plotting and metric functions

Each branch corresponds to a different set of experiments.
